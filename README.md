# IrisApp
This is a simple web app powered by machine learning to predict the type of flower from the most popular iris dataset using LogisticRegression
We have used Logistic Regression to train our model and we have created our web app using Flask Framework.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is not to show the machine learning but rather to show how we can integrate any machine learning model with flask framework and deploy it on the cloud so that it is accessible to every one. 
When you provide all features of flower it predicts the type of flower according to the features provided.

# Side Objective
The second objective is to showcase the use of CRUD operation using the MVC Model of the web app.
